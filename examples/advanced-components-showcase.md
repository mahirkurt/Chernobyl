# Component Library Overview

This document showcases the advanced Carbon Design System components available in the Typst templates.

## Typography Scale

The complete IBM Carbon typography scale is implemented:

- **Display**: `display-01` through `display-04` for hero text
- **Headings**: `heading-01` through `heading-07` for document structure
- **Body**: `body-01`, `body-02`, `body-long-01`, `body-long-02`
- **Code**: `code-01` (inline), `code-02` (blocks)
- **Labels**: `label-01`, `label-02` for form elements
- **Helper Text**: `helper-text-01`, `helper-text-02`
- **Legal**: `legal-01`, `legal-02` for fine print

# Cards and Tiles

## Standard Cards

Cards are containers for related content with consistent padding and borders.

## Feature Cards

Feature cards combine icons with titles and descriptions for highlighting capabilities.

# Badges and Tags

Use badges for status indicators:

- **Default** - Neutral gray for inactive states
- **Success** - Green for completed or positive states
- **Error** - Red for failures or critical issues
- **Warning** - Yellow for caution states
- **Info** - Blue for informational content

Tags are used for categorization and can be dismissible.

# Notifications

## Info Notification

Use for general information that doesn't require immediate action.

## Success Notification

Confirms successful completion of an action.

## Warning Notification

Alerts users to potential issues that need attention.

## Error Notification

Indicates a failure or critical problem requiring immediate attention.

# Callout Boxes

> **Note**: Use callouts to highlight important information that supplements the main content.

> **Tip**: Callouts help readers quickly identify key information without reading every paragraph.

> **Warning**: Be careful not to overuse callouts, as they can lose their impact.

> **Important**: Critical information should always be in a callout to ensure visibility.
